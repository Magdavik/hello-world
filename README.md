# hello-world
This is my almost-first repository. Sorry if I have messed something up.

Writing about yourself is not an easy task because there is always either too much or too less to be said on the subject. 

Born and grown up mostly in Cracow, Poland. Learned German language as my major subject, but worked also in many different areas including public administration and outsourcing companies. Now I am teaching German as a foreign language and learning some coding in my spare time.
